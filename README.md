# Trapezoidal RU Project

Welcome to the Trapezoidal RU Project! This repository contains code and resources for performing numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule.

## Overview

The trapezoidal rule is a numerical method used to estimate the integral of a function. This project demonstrates its implementation in [your preferred programming language, e.g., Python/Java/C++] and includes examples to showcase its applications.

## Features

- Implementation of the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration.
- Support for user-defined functions and intervals.
- Visualizations to demonstrate integration results.
- Optimized for accuracy and performance.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trapezoidal-ru.git
